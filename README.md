Bank Project Details:
The Bank Project is a class assigned project that requires each member of the class to work within a design/programming team and to collaborate with your class as a whole. After you have reviewed the basics of the Agile Development process and identified roles within this process, you will organize your teams and begin to brainstorm ways in which you can ulitmately complete your group's tasks. In order for each student to receive an A, the project MUST be fully functional at a TBD date - failure to produce a fully functional product will result in a maximum grade of a B+ - no higher grade can be achieved if the project is incomplete!! So, let's get started. 



There will be several roles to be assumed and various topics that can be completed. The BASIC requirements are below BUT you are free to add MORE if you wish:  



For this class project, your class has been "hired"  to construct "Banking Software" for a fictiious bank called "Ventoux Bank." I, Mr. Cangelosi, am the Owner and CEO of the bank and have hired your class to develop a FULLY functional banking software platform. 
Your class "software development company" has submitted the lowest contract bid and has promised to deliver the requested banking software platform on time and complete. 
Your company will need to divide the work required amongst yourselves. 
You will need to make sure that related accounts are able to communicate with each other. For example, a customer account main menu will provide the customer with the ability to select their checking, savings, investment, and loan accounst from ONE menu. Once an item is selected, they MUST be able to access that particular account. Remember, user data can be stored in an Array and then later retrieved when needed. 
Your company will need 2 Scrum Masters
The development teams will need to deliver AT LEAST the following FULLY functioning software in order to obtain an A: 
Checking Account
Savings Account
ATM Machine
Safe Deposti Box
Commercial Business Loans
Mortgage Loan
College Loan
Home Equity Loan
Certificate of Deposit Account
Money Market Account
Credit Card/Debit Card
Foreign Currency Exchange 
Online Banking
Insurance Products
